    <h2>who am i?</h2>
    <p>im bea (they/she) im 20, im bad at talking about myself and this is my shitty website</p>
    <p>im a big nerd, i love messing around with different computers, arcade machines, gamedev, all that sorta stuff. generally if i use a computer regularly i will have fucked with it in some stupid barely comprehensible way that's probably awesome</p>
    <p>generally at the moment if i'm not at home or busy i'm probably arcading. my favourite arcade games are probably WACCA and DANCERUSH but there's only one WACCA in the UK and it's not where i live, so most of the time it's just the latter i end up playing. i've been playing it about 8 months and i'd say i'm pretty sick at it.</p>
    <p>fun fact: i dropped out of university when i was 18 (lol)</p>
    <p>i work as a game developer professionally, currently i'm working on <a href="https:/\/www.ea.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> at <a href="https:/\/respawn.com">Respawn</a>, before that i was at <a href="https:/\/lucidgames.co.uk">Lucid Games</a> where i also worked on Apex, as well as some maintenance for the Titanfall games</p>
    <p>my last big personal project was <a href="https:/\/northstar.tf">Northstar</a> which started during COVID and basically got me my whole current career in games, don't work on it anymore though since working on it absolutely fucked my mental health (turns out it's really easy to accidentally crunch yourself for over a year when you don't have anyone to tell you that's what you're doing and no real responsibilities, who knew!) and also because it's probably an NDA violation and a conflict of interest or something like that for me to work on it. idk</p>
