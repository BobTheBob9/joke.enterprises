this is the source for my website, you can build it by running `sh build.sh` (you'll need gcc on your path, don't ask why), it expects to serve files from the directory /web/, so you need to have that present.  
the config for the machine currently serving this is here https://github.com/bobthebob9/nixing-my-x5650. im probably not going to put any work into making it work outside of this specific system but it probably wouldn't be too hard to make it work, just configure nginx to serve from /web/ and run build.sh and it should work. maybe.
